# Problem Statement/Overview

Hotels often struggle to maintain high occupancy rates, especially during seasonal low periods when bookings decline. Maximizing room occupancy is crucial for sustaining revenue and operational efficiency. However, the current approach to driving occupancy relies heavily on manual processes, where Hotel Revenue Managers, Sales & Marketing teams, and General Managers (other external agencies on their behalf) must analyze data, determine the optimal timing for campaigns, and create targeted marketing content.

The manual nature of these tasks results in inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and delayed campaign launches. Moreover, creating and deploying the right content to the right audience at the right time is critical but challenging, especially without the aid of automation. To remain competitive, hotels need a streamlined, automated solution that can dynamically trigger campaigns, optimize their timing, and tailor the content based on real-time data.

How might we develop an automated solution that enables hotels to trigger marketing campaigns at the optimal time during low booking periods and generate customized content that targets the right audience with the appropriate offers? This solution should empower Hotel Revenue Managers, Sales & Marketing teams, and General Managers to maximize occupancy with minimal manual intervention.
Create an creating innovative, automated solutions that address the challenge of optimizing campaign timing and content creation, ultimately driving higher occupancy rates during low periods.
